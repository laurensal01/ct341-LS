        <h1>BharatPe wut founder asks for the removal of CEO from board</h1>
         <p>The other day I heard a story that perfectly illustrates one of the main problems with our current finance system: 
            lack of context. A middle-aged woman was buying $8 worth of lightbulbs at Home Depot when the cashier gave her the 
            spiel about signing up for a Home Depot credit card. The woman, who had excellent credit and rarely applies for new cards, 
            took pity on the cashier, signed up for the card, and charged the lightbulbs. </p>
          <p>Six months later she decided to buy a new house, was approved for the purchase, and started packing. But a week before the 
            closing, she got a call from her long-time lender saying they were rescinding her loan. It turned out she had forgotten to 
            pay that $8 Home Depot credit card bill and, because six months had passed, her credit score had dropped by 40 points. 
            She didnâ€™t get her loan, and she lost the house.</p>
